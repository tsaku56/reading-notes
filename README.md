# TechEd - Ross' Notes

### Introduction  
---

Hello everyone, my name is Ross. I am from a Manufacturing background with an interest in Computing. 

Coding does seem like a colossal challenge but we will help each other through this opportunity.

I am looking forward to going through this journey with everyone and our eventual graduation in the near future.
