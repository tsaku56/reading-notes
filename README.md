# Introduction

Good Morning everyone, my name is Ross. I am from a Manufacturing background with an interest in Computing.  

Coding does seem like a colossal challenge but we will help each other through this opportunity.

I am looking forward to going through this journey with everyone and our eventual graduation in the near future!  

Here's my plan:  

1. Drink Coffee.
2. Do the course.
3. Drink Coffee.
4. Sleep.
