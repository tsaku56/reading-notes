# GitHub? 

Using terminal today we've created a new directory, selected that directory and cloned our GitHub repository. We did this by;

 1. *mkdir 'new directory'* - Make new directory 'name of directory'.
 2. *cd 'new directory'* - Change Directory 'directory you want to select'.
 3. *git clone (link 'example: reading-notes')*  - Clone git repository to your directory.

We then selected this new cloned repos and open this in VS code. We did this by;

 1. *cd 'reading-notes'* - Change directory to new repository.
 2. *code .* - Open VS Code with this repository.

For this lesson, we have to structure our directory to fit the lesson plan. During this process, we followed the A-C-P rules to commit this work back onto GitHub.

1. Saved any current work.
2. *git status* - Will check what current position work is. Changes not staged for commit. Ready for commit and Finally if the branch main is up to date. Can use git status at any stage of A-C-P.
3. *git add .* - all changes are ready to be commited. Using . at the end will select all files.
4. *git commit -m "Comments"* - Using comments is a useful aid to show progress in each commit.
5. *git push* - Which will send off any stages commits back to GitHub and update online.
